# LPG Inventory Management System - Deployment Status

## Current Status
The application has been successfully pushed to GitHub. The code is now available in the repository and can be deployed to Vercel through the Vercel dashboard or GitHub integration.

## Next Steps for Deployment
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project or create a new one
3. Connect to your GitHub repository (chrisraro/lpg-inventory-app1)
4. Configure the project settings:
   - Framework: Next.js
   - Build Command: npm run build
   - Output Directory: .next
5. Add environment variables:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
6. Deploy the project

## Post-Deployment Setup
After deployment is complete:
1. Run the SQL scripts in your Supabase SQL editor:
   - supabase_schema.sql
   - supabase_auth.sql
   - supabase_seed.sql
2. Configure Supabase Auth with email provider
3. Add your deployed URL to Supabase redirect URLs

## Monitoring
- Check Vercel logs for any build errors
- Monitor application performance
- Set up alerts for any issues

The deployment should be straightforward since we've set up the project to work with Vercel's automatic deployments.
