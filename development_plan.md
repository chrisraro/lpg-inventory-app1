# LPG Inventory Management System - Development Plan

## Project Overview
Development of a comprehensive LPG Inventory Management System with QR code scanning, real-time updates, and role-based access control.

## Development Approach
We'll follow an agentic development model with four specialized AI agents:
- **Apex (Full Stack)**: Overall architecture and integration
- **Synapse (Backend)**: Database design, security, and business logic
- **Nova (Frontend)**: User interface, experience, and client-side functionality
- **Vector (QA)**: Testing, validation, and quality assurance

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

### Week 1: Backend Foundation
