# LPG Inventory Management System - Project Summary

## Project Overview
The LPG Inventory Management System is a comprehensive solution for tracking LPG cylinders through their entire lifecycle, from registration to dispatch, delivery, and return. The system features QR code scanning for rapid inventory operations, real-time updates, and role-based access control.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Authentication, Realtime)
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **QR Code Scanning**: html5-qrcode library
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. User Authentication & Authorization
- Secure user registration and login
- Role-based access control (admin, warehouse, delivery)
- Protected routes based on user roles

### 2. Dashboard
- Real-time inventory statistics
- Quick action buttons for common tasks
- Recent cylinder activity feed

### 3. Cylinder Management
- Cylinder registration with unique serial numbers
- Cylinder listing with search and filter capabilities
- QR code generation for each cylinder

### 4. QR Code Scanning
- Rapid scan mode for quick cylinder operations
- Instant visual and auditory feedback on successful scans
- Context-aware actions based on cylinder status

### 5. Real-time Updates
- Instant UI updates when data changes
- WebSocket-based real-time subscriptions
- Optimized performance for concurrent users

## Database Schema
The system includes a comprehensive database schema with tables for:
- User profiles with role management
- Customers (business and residential)
- Cylinder types with specifications
- Individual cylinders with status tracking
- Immutable transaction logs
- Dispatch orders and items

## Security Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Role-based data access control
- Secure authentication with Supabase Auth
- Protected API endpoints

## Agentic Development Approach
The project was developed using four specialized AI agents:
- **Apex (Full Stack)**: Overall architecture and integration
- **Synapse (Backend)**: Database design, security, and business logic
- **Nova (Frontend)**: User interface, experience, and client-side functionality
- **Vector (QA)**: Testing strategy and quality assurance planning

2. Advanced reporting and analytics dashboard
3. Customer management interface
4. Comprehensive testing suite implementation
5. Mobile app optimization
6. Offline capability enhancements

## Conclusion
The LPG Inventory Management System provides a solid foundation for tracking LPG cylinders with modern web technologies. The system is designed to be scalable, secure, and user-friendly, with room for future enhancements and features.
