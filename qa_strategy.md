# LPG Inventory Management System - QA Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the LPG Inventory Management System, ensuring robustness, security, and reliability across all components.

## Testing Approach

### 1. Test Pyramid
- **Unit Tests** (70%): Component logic, utility functions, validation schemas
- **Integration Tests** (20%): API endpoints, database operations, authentication flows
- **E2E Tests** (10%): Critical user journeys, cross-feature workflows

### 2. Testing Tools
- **Unit/Integration**: Jest with React Testing Library
- **E2E**: Playwright for browser automation
- **Database Testing**: pgTAP for PostgreSQL functions and RLS policies
- **Static Analysis**: ESLint, TypeScript compiler checks
- **Security**: OWASP ZAP for API security scanning

## Test Environments
1. **Local Development**: Developer machines with Supabase local development setup
2. **Staging**: Vercel preview deployments with Supabase staging database
3. **Production**: Live environment with production database

## Core Test Scenarios

### Authentication & Authorization
- User registration and login flows
- Role-based access control (admin, warehouse, delivery)
- RLS policy enforcement for all tables
- Session management and timeout handling
- Password reset and email verification

### Cylinder Management
- Cylinder registration with unique serial number validation
- Status transition rules enforcement
- Bulk import functionality
- QR code generation and uniqueness
- Search and filtering capabilities

### Dispatch Operations
- Creation of dispatch orders with multiple cylinders
- Assignment to delivery personnel
- Status progression (pending → dispatched → delivered → returned)
- Concurrent access handling
- Validation of delivery personnel permissions

### QR Code Scanning
- Successful scanning of valid QR codes
- Handling of invalid/unknown codes
- Offline scanning and sync behavior
- Camera permission handling
- Rapid consecutive scanning performance

### Transaction Logging
- Automatic creation of transaction records
- Immutability of transaction data
- Complete audit trail for cylinder history
- Performance impact of transaction logging

### Real-time Updates
- Instant UI updates on data changes
- Correct handling of WebSocket connections
- Fallback behavior during connection loss
- Performance with large numbers of concurrent users

## Role-Specific Test Cases

### Admin User
- Full access to all system features
- User management capabilities
- System configuration options
- Comprehensive reporting access

### Warehouse Staff
- Cylinder registration and inventory management
- Dispatch order creation and management
- Customer management
- Restricted access to administrative functions

### Delivery Personnel
- View assigned dispatch orders only
- Update cylinder status for assigned deliveries
- Scan cylinders for delivery confirmation
- No access to customer or pricing information

## Edge Cases and Error Conditions

### Data Validation
- Empty or missing required fields
- Invalid data formats (e.g., non-numeric weights)
- Duplicate serial numbers
- Excessive input lengths

### System States
- Database connection failures
- Network connectivity issues
- High concurrency scenarios
- Large dataset performance

### Security
- SQL injection attempts
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Session hijacking prevention

## Automated Test Suite Structure

## Database Testing with pgTAP

### RLS Policy Tests
- Verify users can only access permitted data
- Test cross-role data isolation
- Validate row-level security for all tables

### Function Tests
- Test cylinder status transition logic
- Validate transaction logging triggers
- Verify data integrity constraints

## Performance Testing
- Page load times under various network conditions
- Database query performance with large datasets
- Real-time update latency
- Memory usage during extended sessions

## Security Testing
- Penetration testing of API endpoints
- Authentication system vulnerability assessment
- Data encryption verification
- Session management security audit

## CI/CD Integration
1. Run unit tests on every commit
2. Execute integration tests on pull requests
3. Perform E2E tests on staging deployments
4. Conduct security scans weekly
5. Generate test coverage reports

## Test Data Management
- Use factory functions for consistent test data generation
- Implement database seeding for integration tests
- Maintain separate test databases for each environment
- Regular cleanup of test data to prevent performance degradation

## Monitoring and Reporting
- Track test coverage metrics
- Monitor test execution times
- Report flaky tests for investigation
- Maintain dashboard of test results across environments
