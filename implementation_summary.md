# LPG Inventory Management System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've successfully implemented a comprehensive LPG Inventory Management System with the following key features:

## Features Implemented

### 1. User Authentication & Authorization
- Secure user registration and login
- Role-based access control (admin, warehouse, delivery)
- Protected routes based on user roles
- Profile management

### 2. Dashboard
- Real-time inventory statistics
- Quick action buttons for common tasks
- Recent cylinder activity feed

### 3. Cylinder Management
- Cylinder registration with unique serial numbers
- Cylinder listing with search and filter capabilities
- QR code generation for each cylinder
- Status tracking (registered, in_stock, dispatched, delivered, returned, damaged, retired)

### 4. QR Code Scanning
- Rapid scan mode for quick cylinder operations
- Instant visual and auditory feedback on successful scans
- Context-aware actions based on cylinder status
- Offline scanning capability

### 5. Dispatch Order Management
- Create dispatch orders with customers and delivery personnel
- Add/remove cylinders to orders via QR scanning or manual selection
- Track order status (pending, dispatched, delivered, returned, cancelled)
- Assign/unassign delivery personnel
- Update order status based on role permissions

### 6. Real-time Updates
- Instant UI updates when data changes
- WebSocket-based real-time subscriptions
- Optimized performance for concurrent users

### 7. Database Design
- Comprehensive schema with proper relationships
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Automatic transaction logging
- Role-based data access control

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Authentication, Realtime)
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **QR Code Scanning**: html5-qrcode library
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

## Agentic Development Approach
The project was developed using four specialized AI agents:
- **Apex (Full Stack)**: Overall architecture and integration
- **Synapse (Backend)**: Database design, security, and business logic
- **Nova (Frontend)**: User interface, experience, and client-side functionality
- **Vector (QA)**: Testing strategy and quality assurance planning
